# How and from where to start AWS cloud journey ?

I came across one request for an article over a hashnode platform. Being an AWS Cloud enthusiast I thought of sharing all my findings and some research projects to do. 

**Perquisites** : 
 - AWS free tier account to kick off journey
 - Credit card or debit card is mandatory ( It will not charge if you are using rightly free tier resources)

Starting with AWS Cloud is not rocket science which no one can kick off. What exactly you need is passion to explore things and no fear to try out new things. 

**Don't over think how its difficult, Just start** :

Just start. Focus on developing the skills and then delivering. All the help you'll need is available over AWS documentation and youtube videos. Whatever questions you think will get answered over community platforms like StackOverflow, AWS forum etc.

**Interesting services which can try out as newly** : 

 - AWS textract ( its extract text from PDF or image in raw or form format )
