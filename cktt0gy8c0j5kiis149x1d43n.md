## How AWS CloudShell can help you ?

Today, I was doing some experiments on EC2 instances. While doing the experiment I faced one issue: launch failure. It is like launching template failed, to debug this and to know about what is this error, I went through  [AWS troubleshooting documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/ts-as-instancelaunchfailure.html#ts-as-instancelaunchfailure-3) and in that document it was mentioned about trying out `describe-instance-type-offerings` command to see what instance types are offering. I was not using my personal machine where my AWS account or credentials are configured. I was thinking what should I do now ? ü§îü§î

Then I saw a symbol on top navigation of AWS UI about launching an online AWS cloud console UI. Wow, it's superb... Now I no need worry about accessing AWS CLI even if I am not in front of my personal device. If I can access my AWS account from a browser then I can access AWS CLI. 

Interesting facts about AWS CloudShell is it was launched around Dec 2020 but I got to know now. Somebody said "**Problem come with solution and solution come with learning**"
