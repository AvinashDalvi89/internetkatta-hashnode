## Code review process using AWS CodeGuru tool

Hello Devs,

In this article, we will learn how to do the code review process using AWS CodeGuru. Let me tell you first what is CodeGuru and how it works ?

**What is code review **: 

Code review process includes suggestions for optimization of the most expensive line of codes. It checks whether code is readable and understandable by a naive user or not. It includes how function naming has done or getting called etc.

This automation works based on generalised guidelines given by open source code communities and language based. CodeGuru Reviewer uses machine learning to identify critical issues, security vulnerabilities, and hard-to-find bugs during application development to improve code quality. It focuses more on the most expensive lines of code to improvisation.
