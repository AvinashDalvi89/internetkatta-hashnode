When somebody hears about SEO, There will be few questions that come in mind:

*   What exactly does SEO ?
*   Why is SEO ?
*   How does it help ?

I am going to explain about **SEO** but not technically, where as will explain in Lehman terminology where every common person can understand about **SEO**.

First common answer : **SEO** is Search Engine Optimisation for websites , products, mobile apps, for events , for many reason and more fish market also.

Hey wait üñêüèª, where this ‚ÄúFish Market‚Äù came in picture while discussing about **SEO** which online terminology. If you heard this then you are on right track.

Fish Market is only one of example i would like to explain but similarly there are many more example such as Electronic markets, Food Stalls line etc. Let‚Äôs start exercise.

How many went to this kind of market to purchase respective things like fish etc ? Have you heard about mouth publicity there ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúTake 5 for 100 Rs‚Äù or ‚Äú 100 ka 5 ‚Äù etc. What they exactly do ? What is use of this ?

They do SEO of their products. Using this they attract their customer. Take a example in Fish market 10 sellers are sitting in row. One customer entered into market to buy fish. Now question is where that customer will go ? first or second or vice versa ? No. He will go where he will get pull off by my loud publicity and mouth publicity. Out of 10 sellers whoever are having good deal, good loud mouth for publicity, crowd and fresh products like wise multiple parameters. Whoever has higher score like more crowd , good fresh products, louder voice to catch up customer will get new customer. Means its about how you can pull new customer or existing customer to your side.

Lets co relate this example to SEO in technical terms. See below screenshot, what happening there when you search terms ‚ÄúBuy mobile in India‚Äù in Google search multiple results came. Why Amazon came first and Flipkart came second ? like we said above example scoring of seller. Here score of website which depend on how website traffic and trust ( Crowd), Social media publicity ( Mouth Publicity), Google Ads ( Voice Loud Publicity), Backlinks ( Neighbour who refer you seller), Affordable price ( Good Deal). Google robots or any other search engine robots work on some sort of algorithm which gives score to website or app.
