My journey in 2024 was paved long before the year began; it started in the final months of 2023. I am a firm believer in the power of the subconscious mind, and in those reflective moments, I planted two seeds deep within it: *In 2024, I will deliver an international talk, and I will speak at an official AWS event.*

I nurtured these thoughts daily, visualizing them as already achieved, allowing them to guide my actions and intentions. Alongside this, I began preparing myself for the role of a Staff Engineer. Little did I know, the universe was already listening. By the end of 2024, I found myself not just as a Staff Engineer, but as a **Senior Staff Engineer at NuShift**.

This journey wasn't without its challenges, but every step was purposeful, every setback was a lesson, and every small victory was a milestone on the path I had envisioned. This year wasn't just about professional achievements; it was about believing in the unseen, trusting the process, and showing up every single day with intention and resilience.

## **The Staff Engineer Dream: A Road Paved with Failures and Growth**

One of my key aspirations for 2024 was to transition into a Staff Engineer role. But the journey wasn't linear. I faced multiple rejections during interviews, and each one felt like a heavy blow to my confidence. I remember sitting quietly after one particularly tough rejection, questioning whether I was truly cut out for this path. But amidst those moments of doubt, I reminded myself why I started—to grow, to learn, and to contribute at a higher level.

To ensure I was prepared, I went through countless blogs from people who had walked this path before me. I read *The Staff Engineer's Path* and immersed myself in videos, interviews, and success stories. I wanted to understand not just the technical expectations but the mindset, leadership qualities, and the varying interpretations of the role across different companies. I didn't want to step into the role unprepared; I wanted to do justice to it.

Slowly, I began treating each rejection not as a failure, but as feedback. I revisited my preparation, identified weak spots, and sought guidance from mentors who had walked this path before me. Every setback became a stepping stone, every doubt became a question to answer, and every small improvement became a reason to keep going. The road was tough, but it shaped me in ways success never could. I leaned on my experiences, sought mentorship, and slowly started building a roadmap for myself, not just professionally but emotionally. The road is still being paved, but the lessons from those moments will forever remain etched in my journey.

## **Breaking the Habit of Context Switching: The Power of Deep Work**

For years, I had a habit of multitasking and frequently switching contexts. While it seemed productive on the surface, it often left me exhausted, overwhelmed, and surrounded by unfinished tasks. But in 2024, I stumbled upon the book *Deep Work* by Cal Newport, and it completely changed my perspective.

The book taught me the value of focus and uninterrupted work sessions. I'm not saying I've perfected this habit, but something has shifted. I've started noticing improvements in how I manage my tasks, focus on one thing at a time, and make meaningful progress without feeling perpetually drained.

In 2025, I aim to deepen this habit even further—to strike a better balance between my professional and community contributions, and to ensure every effort counts.

## **Mentorship and Judging: 0x.Day Hackathon, Pondicherry**

On December 29th and 30th, I had the incredible opportunity to be a mentor and a final panel judge at the prestigious [0x.Day Hackathon](https://hack.0x.day/) in Pondicherry. With over 500 participants and 130 teams, the energy was electric. Personally evaluating 27 teams was no small feat, but it was equally rewarding.

During the hackathon, I was amazed by several projects focused on social and community impact. One team worked on creating sign language translations from YouTube or any video content, breaking barriers for hearing-impaired individuals. Another team built a voice-hearing application for people who can't listen, offering them a new way to interact with the world. A third project aimed to create an inclusive healthcare ecosystem, ensuring accessibility and care for underprivileged communities. There was even an innovative idea that focused on transforming negative or unclear speech into positive, meaningful communication.

Each of these projects left a lasting impression on me, not just because of their technical ingenuity, but because of the compassion and purpose driving their creators. It reminded me that technology isn't just about innovation; it's about creating meaningful change in people's lives. These young minds showed courage, creativity, and a deep sense of responsibility, and I felt incredibly proud to have been a part of their journey.

In moments like these, I was reminded why events like hackathons matter. It's not just about flawless execution; it's about courage, creativity, and the willingness to try. I felt proud to contribute to nurturing the next generation of builders, one team at a time.

## **International Talks: A Dream Realised (Almost)**

2024 also marked a significant milestone: my first international talk at FOSS Asia. Standing on an international stage, sharing knowledge, and interacting with a global audience was an experience unlike any other. Out of 26 talk submissions this year, three were accepted internationally. However, I could only attend one. The missed opportunities weighed on me initially, but I reminded myself that sometimes, the universe has other plans.

On the brighter side, I successfully delivered four impactful talks at conferences, each one carefully crafted with a storytelling approach to ensure every attendee left with not just insights but inspiration.

## **Community Building: Amplify, Mautic, and Beyond**

This year was also deeply rooted in community contributions. I played a significant role in organizing the **first-ever Mautic Conference in India**, an event that brought together 100+ attendees to share ideas, best practices, and future possibilities for open-source marketing automation.

In parallel, I served as a **supporting organizer for the 30 Days of Amplify event**, hosted by AWS User Group India. Coordinating sessions, engaging participants, and ensuring seamless execution reaffirmed my love for community building and the ripple effect it creates.

I also stepped into the **Mautic community supporting lead role**, a position I was both excited and anxious about. Despite my best intentions, I often felt that I couldn't give the role the justice it deserved. There were moments when I considered stepping away entirely, but I reminded myself why I took on the responsibility in the first place. I continued to contribute in whatever capacity I could, even if it felt small at times. In 2025, I am determined to show up better, contribute more meaningfully, and truly justify the trust placed in me by the community.

## **Mentorship and Judging: 0x.Day Hackathon, Pondicherry**

On December 29th and 30th, I had the incredible opportunity to be a mentor and a final panel judge at the prestigious 0x.Day Hackathon in Pondicherry. With over 500 participants and 130 teams, the energy was electric. Personally evaluating 27 teams was no small feat, but it was equally rewarding.

During the hackathon, I was amazed by several projects focused on social and community impact.

A third project aimed to create an inclusive healthcare ecosystem, ensuring accessibility and care for underprivileged communities. There was even an innovative idea that focused on transforming negative or unclear speech into positive, meaningful communication.

Each of these projects left a lasting impression on me, not just because of their technical ingenuity, but because of the compassion and purpose driving their creators. It reminded me that technology isn't just about innovation; it's about creating meaningful change in people's lives.

## **Fitness and Well-being: Small Habits, Big Changes**

This year, I also focused on staying active and maintaining my well-being. Whether it was playing cricket, hitting the gym, walking, or enjoying a quick game of table tennis, these activities didn't just keep me fit—they kept me happy. They became moments of pause in an otherwise busy schedule, reminding me that while work is important, keeping the mind relaxed is even more essential.

I also implemented a few small but impactful habits: setting a consistent bedtime, reading before sleep, and ensuring my mobile internet was off by 9:30 PM. Although there were occasional exceptions, I mostly stuck to these habits, and they made a significant difference.

This focus on fitness and mental well-being stems from a deeply personal realization. After being admitted to the ICU during the COVID-19 pandemic, I promised myself that I would prioritize my health. Over the past few years, these small initiatives have helped me stay active, reduce stress, and bring a better version of myself to both my professional and personal life.

In 2025, I aim to continue these habits and refine them further to maintain a balance between physical health, mental well-being, and professional excellence.

## **YouTube Journey: Consistency and Growth**

In 2024, I focused on building consistency on my **YouTube channel - Learn with Avinash Dalvi**. I committed to uploading videos **every Tuesday and Saturday**, and this routine brought both discipline and growth to my channel.

📊 **2024 YouTube Milestones:**

* **1,054 New Subscribers**
    
* **82K Views**
    
* **101 Uploads**
    
* **2,272 Likes**
    
* **58 Comments**
    
* **546 Shares**
    

This journey wasn't just about numbers; it was about showing up consistently, sharing knowledge, and building a connection with the audience. In 2025, I plan to keep this momentum going and continue delivering valuable content.

## **AWS re:Invent Nominations: A Moment of Pride**

One of the proudest moments of 2024 was being **nominated in two categories at the AWS re:Invent APJ Community Awards Night**—'Invent & Simplify' and 'Deliver Results.' While I couldn't personally attend the event and didn't win the award, the nomination itself felt like a significant achievement.

Being recognized at such a prestigious platform reassured me that my contributions are making an impact. It felt like a signal to keep going, to keep contributing, and to continue sharing knowledge with the community. This nomination wasn't just an accolade; it was a reminder that consistency and dedication never go unnoticed.

## **Reflections: The Emotional Side of the Journey**

Beyond the technical accomplishments, this year was also about embracing my vulnerabilities. I realized the power of pauses while speaking, the importance of balancing ambition with self-care, and the humility in acknowledging limitations.

There were moments of self-doubt, burnout, and disappointment. But every time I felt stuck, I reminded myself of why I started—to build, to share, to contribute, and to inspire.

## **A Special Thanks to My Strong Pillars: Trupti and Advit**

None of this would have been possible without the unwavering support of my wife, **Trupti**, and my child, **Advit**. They are my strongest pillars, my motivation, and the reason I can step out into the world with confidence and purpose. Their encouragement, sacrifices, and love have been the silent force behind every achievement this year.

## **Looking Ahead: A Vision for 2025**

As I step into 2025, I carry with me the lessons, the wins, and even the scars from 2024. I look forward to growing deeper into my technical expertise and continuing to give back to the community. I am also excited to explore unexplored areas like **AI/ML, Big Data, and Blockchain**. These fields demand more learning, experimentation, and sharing, and I am ready to embrace that challenge.

Stay tuned to my **blog** and [**YouTube channel**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9X-0OwTK4PdbWronkNwXSA/) for updates as we continue to ***Learn Together, Grow Together.*** There are also a few initiatives I'm quietly working on, but I'll reveal them when the time is right.

If there's one takeaway from this year, it's this:

> *"Success isn't always about the applause at the end; it's about showing up, day after day, even when no one's watching."*

Thank you, 2024, for being everything I didn't expect but everything I needed.

Here's to 2025—another year of growth, impact, and storytelling.
