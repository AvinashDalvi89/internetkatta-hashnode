## AWS Lambda monitoring mechanism using SNS

Hello Devs,

I am going to tell you about AWS Lambda monitoring failure or success mechanism using SNS and email notification. Let's understand first background behind this. 

Few months back, i developed one AWS Lambda code using Python. It was working perfect fine. I used one 30 days trial API for testing purpose. Generally API vendor keep sending reminder about expiring free trial period. On last day i didn't get mail or somehow i forgot to check my mail. Due to expiry of API service lambda service stop working this i got to know some of user respond back with failure of service. Then i stared exploring about how should i get information about any kind of failure if something happen wrong in execution of lambda. 

After reading AWS SNS documentation, I found interesting thing about AWS is they introduced lambda trigger end point to SNS services which has multiple communication end point to subscribe like email, SMS, Web hook , External endpoint etc. üëáüèª

1.  Create lambda - can use any language like Python, Node, GoLang etc.

2. Create SNS topic : Go to SNS -> Create Topic -> Select name and display name -> Create

3. Creation subscription for topic: Select Topic -> Create subscription-> Select protocol show in above image-> Create 
4.  Go to SNS -> Mobile -> Text Messaging -> Text messaging preferences -> Edit -> Add budget per day ( $1 per day )  [SMS pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/sms-pricing/) 
5. Make sure lambda execution role has access to publish to SNS topic. 
6. Go to lambda -> Add Destination -> Asynchronous invocation -> Select Success or Failure -> Destination as SNS -> Select topic 

They we are done! üëçüèª
