The lights were bright, the crowd buzzing, and everything looked perfect — but just hours before the show began, I stood still backstage, feeling a familiar knot in my stomach. Not out of fear, but from the weight of a moment that had been years — maybe a decade — in the making. I didn’t fully understand why it meant so much, not yet.

That clarity came later. Like all good stories — this one started with a spark, but the meaning would only unfold with time.

> **Great teams aren’t built on agreement — they’re built on shared purpose.”**

That one line sums up our journey toward AWS Community Day Bengaluru 2025.

What started in December as a simple conversation soon turned into months of collaboration, debates, design chaos, speaker curation, and pure execution energy.  We came in with diverse roles — some of us focusing on speakers, some on partnerships, others on content, marketing, logistics, or tech. We didn’t always agree, but we never lost sight of the goal: delivering a memorable experience for the community.

### The Start: Vision to Action

The vision was simple — make this the most meaningful and elevated version of ACD Bengaluru yet. Bigger in scale, deeper in content, richer in community vibes. But turning that vision into action meant asking tough questions and making bold decisions.

We explored venue options, discussed format changes, and debated everything — from the layout of tracks to the type of workshops we wanted to host. It all started with a WhatsApp group and a few Google Meet calls. Weekend working sessions were filled with passionate arguments — and what's more magical is that the entire team never met in person, not even once. Yet, the synergy and symphony were real, because our goal was always clear and shared.

This was my first time organizing an event at such a large scale. Last year, I had organized **Mautic Conference India** in Pune — a proud moment with about 100 participants [shared here](https://www.internetkatta.com/from-fan-to-organizer-my-incredible-journey-with-mautic-conference-india). And I had volunteered for **ACD BLR 2024**, which was hosted at the Amazon office. But stepping up to co-lead the effort at a grand venue like **Conrad Bengaluru** was a completely different level. The stakes were higher, the pressure was real — but so was the passion.

That moment brought back an old, bittersweet memory. Back in engineering college, I had one dream: to become the **CSR (Cultural Representative)** — the person who would run the college fest, rally the teams, and own the spotlight. But college politics had other plans. I never got that role. That unfulfilled dream stayed tucked away — quietly lingering.

Yet, life has its own timeline. Organizing ACD BLR 2025, in front of hundreds of people, with a team I admire — it felt like that dream found its way back to me, not in the place I first imagined, but in a space where I was truly meant to lead, contribute, and shine. A heartfelt thanks to **Bhuvana**, **Jones**, and **Ayyanar** for trusting and believing in me with this opportunity — your confidence made all the difference.

Sometimes, you don’t get to live that dream in the place you imagined. But you get something better — a stage that truly values your intent, a platform where your efforts shine, and a team that believes in your vision. **This was that moment for me.**

### The Build-Up: Decisions, Deadlines, and Dilemmas

As we moved into execution, the real challenges began. From finalising keynote speakers to rolling out creative ticket sale campaigns, each step required hustle, agility, and relentless problem-solving. We tested virtual photo booths, tweaked LinkedIn promos, crafted FOMO posts, created session posters, curated cue cards for emcees, and pulled off a social media blitz powered by our volunteers.

We also kickstarted two powerful community-led initiatives:

* **Blogathon**: A platform for community members to share their AWS learnings, stories, and hands-on experiments. It amplified new voices and celebrated the diverse experiences across our builder ecosystem.
    
* **Voice of AWS UG Bengaluru**: A new storytelling series where we spotlight the journeys, challenges, and achievements of our local AWS User Group members — giving a voice to the builders who power our community.
    

Two moments stood out for me as serendipitous reminders of how everything comes full circle:

The first was when my engineering college friend **Sagar**, who now runs an event management company called StudioB3, showed up at ACD. We hadn’t met in over 12 years. He’s been doing events for more than a decade — something I had completely forgotten. But someone once told me, *"When your time comes, the right people will show up to help you."* Reconnecting with Sagar at this moment felt like that kind of magic.

The second was when **Talvinder Singh**, founder of [zop.dev](https://zop.dev/), reached out via my official email regarding AWS cloud services. I could’ve replied formally, but instead, I sent him a message from my personal email — pitching the idea of sponsorship. And guess what? Talvinder turned out to be a former client from my time at Sodel Solutions. A full-circle moment, reminding me that when you build good relationships, people remember you.

Both moments reminded me that success is never solo — it's shaped by people, timing, and the relationships you nurture along the way.

It wasn’t perfect. And that’s what made it special.

### A Moment to Recharge Before Show Time

Just before the final days of prep for ACD BLR 2025, a last-minute yet incredibly meaningful opportunity came our way — the inauguration of the **first AWS Cloud Club in Bengaluru** at **Ramaiah Institute of Technology**. The college had invited AWS UG leaders to attend the event alongside our keynote speaker **Vivek Raja P S**. Though **Jason**, Senior Program Manager of AWS Community Builders, couldn't join due to unforeseen reasons, his spirit was very much present.

Spending half a day there, celebrating the new generation of cloud enthusiasts, was a refreshing break — and a reminder of *why* we do this in the first place. Right after the ceremony, we were back in execution mode — refining ACD details, tying up loose ends, and getting ready to welcome hundreds of builders to Bengaluru.

### The Day(s): Goosebumps, High-Fives, and Happy Faces

This time, I was doing something I’d never done before — speaking in front of the entire audience in the combined auditorium. Over the years, I’ve spoken in tracks and breakout rooms, but this was different. Bigger. A little scary. And deeply exciting. What made it even more special was sharing that stage with **Vivek Raja P S**, someone I deeply respect.

I wasn’t prepared the way I usually like to be — there were just too many moving parts in the days leading up to the event. But I reminded myself: I’ve been on stage more than 30 times. I knew I could pull through.

We tried something different — a conversational-style talk instead of a standard slide-heavy presentation. And to our surprise, many people came up to us afterward saying it helped them understand complex topics more easily. That made us smile. And just like that, the nervousness faded.

I didn’t know how the moment would unfold. Maybe we’d make mistakes. Maybe something wouldn’t go as planned. But I knew this for sure — we had built this event with heart.

* For every learner.
    
* Every builder.
    
* Every dreamer walking into ACD Bengaluru.
    

Walking into the venue, seeing everything come together — the tracks, booths, branding, swag, and smiles — was an emotional moment for many of us. The reactions from attendees, speakers, and sponsors reminded us that all the hard work had meaning.

Whether it was a packed Exhibition Lounge, a selfie with Jason (yes, that happened), or just the quiet moment of seeing a community member feel seen and celebrated — those were the wins we carried home.

### What Made It Work?

* **Community-first thinking** in every decision

### Life Behind the Curtain

They say,

> *"A smooth sea never made a skilled sailor."*

And ACD BLR 2025 wasn’t just a journey of coordination — it was a test of balance, resilience, and purpose.

In the midst of all the planning and execution, life threw its own challenges. I was navigating some unexpected health issues — a gastrointestinal scare that pushed me to completely rethink my lifestyle and embrace fitness and clean eating. Just when I was finding a rhythm, my wife had to undergo a sudden surgery. Managing doctor visits, home responsibilities, a full-time job, and community commitments — it felt like everything hit at once.

But through it all, my family stood like a rock. They never once said, “Pause the community work.” They encouraged it. They believed in it. They believed in me. And that quiet support — the kind that doesn’t need applause — is what carried me through the chaos.

### A Personal Note

As someone who’s been part of many community events, ACD BLR 2025 felt different. It was intense, emotional, and fulfilling. It proved once again that when builders, doers, and dreamers come together with clarity of purpose — magic happens.

### To the Team:
