# What I learned from The Leader who had no title book ?

Hello Readers, 

Generally I start a blog with "Hello devs " but today I start with "Hello Readers" because this blog is not technical learning. This blog is about learning which I got from book "**The Leader Who Had No Title**" - Robin Sharma. 

One year back, June 2021 due to Covid I got admitted to hospital. I was in the hospital almost 15 days and after getting discharged again 10 days only rest. In my whole life I never had such an incident where I got disconnected from study or work or passion. This is first I got disconnected almost 25 days which result to down my moral and feel like something I lose in those 25 days. I share a situation with my wife about feeling demotivated about what to do. She suggested two things to me: if you have completed 10 years in IT why not write a blog on your journey which can help you show what you have done so far. So, I wrote a blog on my journey and that gave me a boost. The link is given at the bottom just to keep readers engaged in this blog. Second thing she asked me to get some book which I might like to read. So there are many books I got while searching on Amazon or Flipkart, even I asked my twitter network about this. I got a few recommendations out of that options one book caught my eye and stuck there.  That book was "**The Leader Who Had No Title**".

Let's learn about what I read from book. I will go chapter wise and write down what is taken away from the highlighted statement. 

## Note : 
Before reading start keep note of this. Most of proverb or statement I picked up as it to keep same feeling of thoughts what writer wish to convey to reader. 

## What I learned : 

### Chapter 1 (Leadership and success are your birthright ) 

> Each of us is born into genius 

Everyone has a different power and talent to showcase to the world. Most people don't realise what talent or power they have. Sadly most of us die amid mediocrity. 

>Nobody succeeds beyond his or her wildest expectations unless he or she begins with some wild expectations.  - RALPH CHARELL 

Rightly said. To reach mountains height requires crazy goals or dreams which can live in life. Take example of all big brands in the world all have craziness to create something different. Without that craziness it is never possible. Nothing is late in life to start, only we have to keep goal alive. 

> The sight of an achievement is the greatest gift a human being could offer others. - AYN RAND 

Whatever you achieve in life, share with others to inspire them, motivate them to do similar or different things that they wish to do. Wake them to live for that crazy dream. I started doing open source contributions by looking at achievements shared by developers. I was inspired by them then started thinking about what I am doing. Give a good feeling when you can see others are growing with small help or information which you share with them. 

### Chapter 2 : 

> The days come and go like muffled and veiled figures sent from a distant friendly party but they say nothing. And if we do not use the gifts they bring, they carry them silently away. - RALPH WALDO EMERSON. 

Getting lost along your path is a part of finding the path you're meant to be on. Sometimes we need to get off track before we can develop the clarity to be on track. 

In the theatre they say, 'No role is a small role'.  Similarly every organisation has to build revolutionary model where 
- Everyone needs to show leadership.
- Everyone needs to drive innovation
- Everyone needs to inspire their teammates. 
- Everyone needs to embrace change.
- Everyone needs to take responsibility for results. 
- Everyone needs to be positive
- Everyone needs to become devoted to expressing their absolute best. 

We all need to lead where we are planted and shire where we now find ourselves. It's all about doing great work - right where you now stand. If people in every organisation - from companies to governments to communities to schools embraced this concept - the whole world would transform. To do this you don't have to have a title to be leader. 
This is called **LWT** - **Lead without title**. 

### Chapter 3 

> Only the mediocre die always at their best. Real leaders are always improving - and raising their bar on how superbly they can perform and how quickly they can move - JEAN GIRAUDOUX

Leadership is for everyone. I have learned about leadership is that leaders are those individuals who do the things that failures aren't willing to do. Even though they might not like doing them either. One thing is important to mention here is leadership isn't only something to do at work. We need to practise leadership within every arena we play. It's ever so important to model leadership in our health, demonstrate with our loved ones, reflect leadership around our finances, and live leadership within our communities. And the foundation of it all is self-leadership. If you can't lead yourself, you'll never be able to lead anyone around you. 

It's fine to be content, but never be satisfied. So improve everything. Improve it all, daily, relentlessly, and passionately.

**What is success** ? 

Success is created through the performance of a few small daily disciplines that stack up over time to produce achievements far beyond anything you could have even planned for. 

Failure, on the other hand, is just as easy to slip into. Failure is nothing more than the inevitable outcome of a few small acts of daily neglect performed consistently over time so that they take you past the point of no return. 
They both are opposite to each other. 

### Chapter 4  ( You need no title to be a leader ) 

> If a man is called to be street sweeper, he should sweep streets as Michelangelo painted or Beethoven composed music or Shakespeare poetry. He should sweep the streets so well that all the host of heaven and earth will pause to say, "Here lived a great street sweeper who did his job well." 
- DR. Marthin Luther King Jr. 

> The most common way people give up their power is by thinking they don't have any. - Alice Walker 

In this chapter the lead person of the book met with hotel housekeeper lady Anna. What she said about her job is 
![WhatsApp Image 2022-05-08 at 8.26.43 AM.jpeg](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1651978627007/JHqpgY2U6.jpeg align="left")

Which is true how we look at our job is in control and how power up that role is also in our hands. Look at our role and what we are doing from a different angle and play that role as great characters in theatre. What society thinks is of no interest to me for my role. All that's important is how I see myself. I know who I am. I know the value of my work. I find ways to challenge myself each day. And I've made this job into something really meaningful to me. 

Never play victim! It's impossible to build a tribute to success on a foundation of excuses. Great people construct monuments with stones their critics throw at them, you know. There is one story of great Indian teacher **Savitribai Phule** who fought for girl education in India at that time when only boys were getting education. She said that when Savitribai Phule went to school, the villagers used to throw stones and dung at her. 

> Brother, I am doing a good job educating your sisters. The stones and dung you throw can’t stop me, but they inspire me. It is as if you are showering flowers. I will definitely continue my work. 

Critics generally criticise you only because at some level, they care. When they stop saying anything, it's because you no longer matter to them. It's when no one criticises you that you should really be worried. 

Anna mentioned the 4 natural power's :

Simply remember that no matter what your position within any organisation and no matter how old you are or where you live throughout the world, you have the power to show leadership. And no one and nothing can ever deny you that. There are no extra people alive today. Every person and every job matters, and all work can be made meaningful with the **Lead Without a Title** philosophy. 

Defining innovation and creative mastery is to be all about making this day better than yesterday. Relentlessly rethink the way you work. Constantly be asking yourself questions like 'How can I boost my productivity?' 'How can I work faster?'  and 'How can I wow my customer even more ?' Regularly put yourself in the shoes of buyers and experience what it's like to do business with you. 

> Without innovation, life is death and only the brave will survive these days. 

> Daily ripples of excellence - over time - become a tsunami of success. 

If we want to change something, take the first step towards it. That first step truly is always the hardest. Because you are fighting the forces of gravity of your old thinking and habits. Because bing changes are scary. But anyone can complete five tiny goals in a day. And Small daily improvements over time really do lead to stunning results. Just imagine what level of confidence you will have after twelve month from today if you achieved a thousand  goals. 

Be who you are and say what you feel because those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind. 

Extraordinary person. Superb athlete. And he makes a key point : stay committed to your mission, values and the full self expression of your inner leader even when people doubt you. When people say you'll fail or suggest you're not good enough, stand strong in your own skin and don't let them tear you down. Because leadership has a lot to do with believing in yourself when no one else believes in you.

### Chapter 5 (Turbulent Times Build Great Leaders )

> Pain is temporary, Quitting lasts forever - Lance Armstrong 

The fear you move through when you go to the edge of your limits actually causes your limits to expand.  When you go to your limits, your limits will expand. Remember one thing, you will never know how high you can climb if you don't even try. The more time you spend outside of your comfort zone, the wider it grows. The fact was the bigger the risks that were present, the larger the rewards that were available. 

All of the fears that are chaining your progress as a leader and as a person are nothing more than the lies you've sold yourself. Stop investing in them! Because life's just too big to play small. Change is always messiest in the middle. Sometimes it can look like nothing's working and zero is happening. But if you are doing your best to learn and make things better, you are actually moving closer to the breakthrough we all want.

"Problems are only problems when we make them problems. Victims cry, "Why me ?" Leaders, on the other hand, shout, ``It's up to me!" 

Focus on the Best and Neglect All the Rest. Leadership is about knowing very little about most things and staggering about a few things. I'd suggest you not allow the opinions of others get the best of you. Keep moving forward. Obstacles just show up to measure how badly you want something. 

Always remember that initiative and hard work is the warm-up act for a headliner called Success. 

The 5 rules to follow **SPARK** : 
**S**peak with Candor 
**P**rioritize
**A**dversity Breeds Opportunity
**R**espond Versus React
**K**udos for everyone

> Life begins at the end of your comfort zone - Neale Donald Walsch


### Chapter 6 ( Deeper Your Relationships, the Stronger Your Leadership )

> Then the most important single ingredient in the formula of success is knowing how to get along with people. - Theodore Roosevelt

> You get the best out of others when you give the best of yours.- Harry Firestone

Remember, small daily improvements, over time, lead to stunning results. Because change is always hardest at the beginning. 

The main business of business is to connect with - and add value to -people. With all the technology, disruption, competition, and transition in the business world today, a lot of us have forgotten that the whole game is about relationships- and human connections. Irony is that the stronger the bonds between you and your teammates - as well as with the customers you work for - the stronger the results.

If you want more support, give more support. If you want more appreciation, give away more appreciation. If you want more respect, you need to be giving respect first. And then it will all come back to you in the river. Leading by example is one of the most powerful tools for positively influencing change in other people. 

If you are really serious about winning in business, become a walking, talking, living, breathing hub radiating positive energy, excellence, and kindness to every person you are fortunate enough to help. 

Important of all leadership skills: deep listening. Speak less and listen more. For most of us our egos are screaming so loudly we have no ears to hear what anyone else is saying. 

We all have a voice inside of us. We all want to express it. And when we feel that someone's taken the time to hear and acknowledge it, we open ourselves up to that person.  Leadership is about listening. And allowing others to feel heard. Take care of people and the money will take care of itself. Help people get to their goals, and people will help you get every single one of yours. 

People are really the most important element to a winning business. 

Be a **HUMAN** rule : 
- **H**elpfulness
- **U**nderstanding
- **M**ingle
- **A**muse
- **N**urture


### Chapter 7 ( To be a great leader, first become a great person ) 

> If everyone was satisfied with themselves, there would be no heroes - Mark Twain. 

> "Tough Times Make Great Leaders "

Lead yourself first. Only then will you get to a place as a person where you can lead other people. Do the inner work required to make your character richer, your intentions purer, and your acts bigger. Who I am becoming is far more important than what I am. 

Real leadership involves breaking through the limits of your mind so you can step into the highest strengths of your spirit.  

How do I begin to break through the mental barrier ? 

You have to take full responsibility for the thoughts you run through your brain. Even one bad thought is like a germ in your mind that attracts more germ to it. Because when your mind is healthy, your stained-glass window is clear.  Berry Gordy Jr. Once said, 'A winner is a winner before he's become a winner.' 

The 7 fundamentals of Personal Leadership is : 

1.  Learning
2. Affirmations
3. Visualisation
4. Journaling 
5. Goal setting 
6. Exercise
7. Nutrition

The way you start your day determines how well you will live your day. Learn to forgive the people you need to forgive and release things that happened in the past that might be consuming your precious creative potential. You can't craft a superb future by remaining stuck in your past. Because disappointments you are holding on to are holding onto your power. By freeing yourself of them you free up a tone of energy, passion and potential. 

There is **SHINE** Rule of this chapter : 
- **S**ee Clearly 
- **H**ealth is wealth 
- **I**nspiration matters 
- **N**eglect not your family 
- **E**levate your lifestyle
